# A Comprehensive Analysis of Pollution and Weather Data (2000-2016)

This project explores pollution levels across The United Stes from 2000-2016, analysing their relationship with weather patterns. It leverages multiple datasets to uncover insights into air quality, climate trends and their broader environmental impact.

## Business Requirements
| Requirement | Visualization |
|------------|--------------|
| Identify trends in air pollution over time and locations | Time series graphs |
| Assess the correlation between pollution and weather factors | Correlation matrices |
| Provide actionable insights for policymakers and environmental agencies | Geographic heatmaps |
| Enhance accessibility of pollution data | Interactive map visualizations in Streamlit |


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
- **Hypothesis 1:** Higher temperatures correlate with increased pollution levels. 
- **Hypothesis 2:** Urban areas exhibit higher pollution levels than rural areas. 
- **Hypothesis 3:** Weather factors such as wind speed and humidity impact pollution dispersion

## Validation 
- **Validation 1:** Analyze the correlation between temperature and key pollutants (O₃, PM2.5, NO₂, CO) using statistical and machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees) to predict pollution levels.
- **Validation 2:** Segment data by location type (urban vs. rural) and analyze pollution patterns using descriptive statistics, visualizations (e.g., box plots, heatmaps), and clustering techniques (e.g., K-means).
- **Validation 3:** Analyze the relationship between wind speed, humidity, and pollution levels using correlation analysis, time-series methods for seasonal trends, and regression models to quantify their impact.

## Modeling Plan for Air Quality Prediction:
 We will create 4 models for predicting air quaility levels: 
 1. Ozone (O₃) 
 2. Particulate Matter (PM2.5) 
 3. Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)
 4. Carbon Monoxide (CO) 

 Each model will be built using machine learning techniques such as: 
 - **Linear Regression:** Baseline predictive analysis
 - **Decision Trees & Random Forest: **Capturing non-linear relationships 
 - **Neural Networks (if applicable):** For adanced forecasting
 - **Evaluation Metrics:** RMSE, MAE, R² score

- Filter data for selected 10-year period and locations  

### **Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Conduct descriptive statistics  
- Perform correlation analysis (pollution vs. weather)  
- Visualize pollution trends & distribution  
- Create map to display pollution data in Streamlit  
- Add weather data to Streamlit visualizations  

### **Phase 3: Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing**
- Define and document key hypotheses  
- Apply machine learning transformations to key measures

- Develop Streamlit dashboard for data exploration  
- Implement a data manipulation page  
- Integrate visualizations for interactive insights  

### **Phase 5: Deployment & Finalization**
- Deploy Streamlit app on Heroku  
- Final review, documentation, and improvements  

## **Approach & Methodology**

### **Data Handling & Management**
- **Collection**: Data gathered from pollution and weather sources  
- **Processing**: Cleaning, missing value treatment, and merging datasets
